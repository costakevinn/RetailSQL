# RetailSQL — Relational Data Platform

RetailSQL is a **relational data platform** designed to model and enforce **core retail business processes** such as **sales transactions**, **product catalog**, **store operations**, and **inventory tracking**.

The project focuses on **data modeling**, **integrity enforcement**, and **relational correctness**, treating the database as a **first-class system component** rather than an analytical artifact.

---

## Core Data Model

RetailSQL models retail operations through a **normalized relational schema** composed of:

* **STORE** — physical retail locations
* **PRODUCT** — product catalog
* **SALES_ORDER** — transactional sales events
* **SALES_ORDER_ITEM** — line-level sales details
* **INVENTORY_SNAPSHOT** — point-in-time inventory states

All relationships are explicitly defined, with no redundant or derived attributes.

## Business Rules at the Data Layer

RetailSQL encodes business rules **directly in the database**, ensuring that invalid states cannot be persisted.

Examples include:

* Quantities must be strictly positive
* Monetary values must be non-negative
* A product cannot appear more than once in the same sales order
* Inventory snapshots are unique per *(date, store, product)*
* All transactional records require valid references

These rules are enforced via **PRIMARY KEY**, **FOREIGN KEY**, **UNIQUE**, and **CHECK** constraints.

---

## Relational Integrity

The model guarantees consistent relationships across entities:

```
SALES_ORDER_ITEM → SALES_ORDER → STORE
SALES_ORDER_ITEM → PRODUCT
INVENTORY_SNAPSHOT → STORE
INVENTORY_SNAPSHOT → PRODUCT
```

This structure supports reliable joins and downstream data consumption.

---

## Example: Relational Join

A typical multi-entity join across the transactional model:

```text
sales_order_id | store_code | sku      | quantity
---------------+------------+----------+----------
1              | S001       | SKU-1001 | 2
1              | S001       | SKU-3001 | 1
2              | S002       | SKU-2001 | 1
```

This confirms that the schema supports **unambiguous joins** without duplication or data leakage.

---

## Example: Inventory Snapshot

Point-in-time inventory state per store and product:

```text
snapshot_date | store_id | product_id | on_hand
--------------+----------+------------+---------
2026-01-07    | 1        | 1          | 100
2026-01-07    | 2        | 3          | 100
```

Inventory is modeled as **state**, not as transactional movement.

## Verification Queries

RetailSQL includes a set of inspection queries to validate:

* Existing tables and schema objects
* Row counts after seeding
* Foreign key relationships
* Constraints per table
* Index definitions
* Sample data consistency

Full outputs are available in:

```

```

Each SQL layer has a single responsibility, mirroring production database practices.

---

## Why This Matters

RetailSQL demonstrates the ability to:

* Translate **business requirements into relational structures**
* Design **normalized schemas** aligned with real systems
* Enforce **data quality at the storage layer**
* Build **foundational data platforms** suitable for analytics and machine learning pipelines

This is the type of data layer expected in environments where **data correctness directly impacts models, metrics, and decisions**.
